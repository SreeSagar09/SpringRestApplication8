A Program to demonstrate the use of @RequestBody annotation:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ApplicationController.java
* Product.java
Notes:
* The @RequestBody annotation is used to extract request body from web request and bind them to method arguments.
* This annotation can is used at parameter level.
* The body of the request is passed through the HttpMessageConverter to convert the body into the method argument type.
* The @RequestBody annotation can accept one attribute, that is required.
* The required attribute default value is true, this is to make request body as mandatory and non-mandatory.
* If the required attribute is true but that request didn't have request body then that request gives '400 - Bad Request'.
